# Lab week6

### Exercise 1 - misc functions
Implement the functions located in `include/ais1002/exercises/exercise1.hpp`.

### Exercise 2 - Random generator
Implement the function located in `include/ais1002/exercises/exercise2.hpp`.  
Use the class `real_random_generator` located in 
`include/ais1002/real_random_generator.hpp`   
as the basis for your implementation.

### Exercise 3 - File I/O
Implement the functions located in `include/ais1002/exercises/exercise3.hpp`.   
When in doubt, search online for how to accomplish file I/O in C++.

### Exercise 4 - Using an API
Implement the functions located in `include/ais1002/exercises/exercise4.hpp`.  
The idea is to use API functions in `vector3` and `matrix4`. So make sure you look at the source code!
